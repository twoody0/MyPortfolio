      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I'm Tyler Woody, a software developer with a background in computer science and a deep passion for building efficient, user-focused web applications.
        I transitioned from a military career into tech, driven by a love for problem-solving and the creative freedom that coding brings.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I specialize in full-stack development using tools like Vue.js, C#, and ASP.NET Core. Whether I'm working on a personal project or collaborating on a team,
        I care deeply about clean architecture, thoughtful UX, and scalable design patterns.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        My current goal is to join a forward-thinking software team where I can continue to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful, real-world applications.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me gaming on my PS5 or PC, hiking around the Pacific Northwest, or brainstorming new app ideas over coffee.
